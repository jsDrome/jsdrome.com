# Machine configuration

&nbsp;

## Summary

I personally tend to use state of the art hardware and software for my development work. For Web/App development which involves frontend, backend, devops, testing work, I prefer the below software specs. Using these will save a lot of time in the long run and without these, its easy to get frustrated. Like for example, the speed of your code build depends on your build process which indirectly depends on your machine specs. A faster machine and an efficient build process ensure a faster feedback and encourages a fail fast, fail often mechanism. Or a complex Web App may consume a lot of your resources.

## Machine

 - **MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019)**

### Operating System

 - **macOS Catalina ** *10.15*

 I prefer a Linux based machine rather than Windows. Simply because web development involves a lot of unix commands, shortcuts etc and a linux based machine offers just that. I have used Windows 95, 98, 97, XP, Vista, 7, 10, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, and many other variants of linux. But Mac OS provides the best performance. Although I would love to have an iMac someday so that I can see all windows at once (because I always have VS Code, Youtube or a live Cricket match or Netflix, the local build of the app, Android emulator and an IOS emulator at all times) instead of having to constantly switch between workspaces and tabs, I havent bought it yet.
